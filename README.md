Vim config
========
Only work on Vim 7.4 or later!

I just test on OS X Version 10.9 and Ubuntu 13.10 x64.

If you have your own .vimrc, .vim, etc.
========

Please backup your configuration.

Attention: this configuration's vimrc file is ~/.vim/vimrc. So if you have ~/.vimrc, please remove/rename it.

After clone:
========
You can move Vim\_config to ~/.vim

```
mv Vim_config ~/.vim
```
or
```
ln -s Vim_config ~/.vim
```

Then run this command:
```
:PlugInstall
```

Reminder: in this configuration, YouCompleteMe need compile. You can find the instruction from:
https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe

And enjoy!
